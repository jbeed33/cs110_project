## UC Tutors - "Connecting Students, Empowering Learning."

## Meet the Developers

Joshua Beed - I am the Lead Developer for UC Tutors. I helped plan, design, and implement features for the application such as authentication, recommendation system, and message system to name a few. I also designed the database schemas and served as the database administrator. Finally I acted as a solo backend developer and was reponsible for making decisions for the overall system.

Aidan Ching - 

Jason Guan -  I designed the login page and built the messaging system for UC Tutors. I focused on creating a user-friendly login experience and ensuring smooth communication between users.

Joseph Flores - I am the front-end developer for the signup page, the filter, and the settings components. I ensured the styling and the variables communicated across servers were consistent and properly named.


## What is UC Tutors?

This app allows UC students to get paired with other students on campus who feel they understand the material well enough to tutor others. We have seen how some upper and lower division classes can be tough for students, and some schools do not offer tutoring for certain courses. They mainly focus on the notoriously difficult ones and leave some other classes without tutors. With our app, we aim to bridge that gap and make it easier for students to help each other.
